# Iteration
- iteration is a normal control flow. 'for'， ‘while’ or 'do-while' is all iteration.
- Example:
- 
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
            sum = sum+i;
        }

# Recursion
- Recursion is hard to understand, lets see the example first.
- Example:
- 
        public int getSum(int n){
            if(n==1){
                return 1;
            }
            return n+getSum(n-1);
        }// this example could add number from 1 to n
- The definiation of recursion is a program(function) use it self to calculate.
- for more information should see this:
- [examples and explaintation](http://www.toves.org/books/java/ch17-recur/index.html)
- Best way to understand recursion: I think is to remember the aim for this recursion and the format of this recursion. It will be hard try to remember the detail of the recursion.
